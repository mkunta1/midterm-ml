# 🍄 Mushroom Classification Project

## Overview
This project analyzes the **UCI Machine Learning Repository's Mushroom Dataset** to classify mushrooms as **edible** or **poisonous** using machine learning techniques. The analysis emphasizes the importance of **feature selection** and **model validation** in binary classification tasks.

## Key Features

- ✅ **Binary Classification** (edible vs. poisonous mushrooms)
- 🔍 **Feature Analysis and Selection**
- 🌲 **Random Forest** and **Decision Tree** Models
- 🔁 **Cross-Validation** and Performance Metrics
- 💡 **One-hot encoding** implementation for handling categorical features

## Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Scikit-learn 🔧
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)


## Key Findings
- Achieved initial 100% accuracy with strong predictors
- Cross-validation scores ranged from 81.59% to 100%
- Weaker features resulted in 86.83% accuracy
- Feature selection dramatically impacts model performance
